    <br />
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 onion, minced</li>
      <li>½ cup large carrot(60 g), peeled and minced</li>
      <li>½ cup celery stalk(110 g), minced</li>
      <li>1 lb ground beef(455 g)</li>
      <li>1 lb ground pork(455 g)</li>
      <li>salt, to taste</li>
      <li>pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup can of tomato paste(110 g)</li>
      <li>2 cups red wine(480 mL)</li>
      <li>4 cups diced tomato(800 g)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
      <li>Add the olive oil and butter to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once warmed, add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 10-12 minutes. Once the vegetables have caramelized, add the beef, pork, salt, pepper, and tomato paste. Stir to combine, breaking up the pieces of meat, until the meat has browned, 15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once the sauce is dark brown and starting to stick slightly to the bottom of the pan, add the red wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release all the cooked brown bits. Once the wine comes to a simmer, add the diced canned tomatoes, and stir to combine. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for at least 30 minutes (the longer the better!) stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta, basil, Parmesan, parsley, egg, salt, and pepper.</li>
      <li>In a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) glass baking dish, add a layer of bolognese to the bottom. Top with noodles, then spread a layer of the ricotta mixture on top. Repeat with another layer of bolognese, noodles, ricotta, noodles, bolognese, then top with mozzarella and additional Parmesan. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
      <li></li>
      Remove the foil and bake for another 15 minutes, until the cheese on top has browned and the bolognese is bubbling. Slice and serve
    </ul>
